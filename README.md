# GifTastic

This application pulls a collection of gifs from giphy.com and presents a static version of the gifs until the user clicks on it, then it switches to the gif image.

## How it works

First the user has to click on a topic to display a collection of gifs related to the topic. The user can also add a new topic.

Then the user can click on any image to see the gif of the image.

## Try it!
